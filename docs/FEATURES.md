# Features

Repository-level inventory for `eco-mods`.

## Forgejo CI

- `.forgejo/workflows/ci.yml` runs on pushes to `main`, pull requests, and
  guarded manual dispatches.
- The gate covers root hygiene, package-tool tests, the proxy-backed `mods/`
  C# build, and repo-level secret scanning.
- Main and manual runs publish nine independent, install-ready Forgejo generic
  packages. Each job fetches only its mod's committed Git LFS runtime assets and
  fails closed on unmaterialized pointers. See [mod-packages.md](mod-packages.md).
- Unity build pipelines are intentionally out of scope for this first pass.
- The legacy GitHub-only TruffleHog workflow was replaced with Forgejo-native coverage.

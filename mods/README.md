# eco-mods-public

A collection of public C# gameplay mods for [Eco](https://play.eco/), Strange Loop Games' multiplayer survival and simulation game. The mods add new professions, recipes, crafting stations, farming extensions, environmental systems, and mining and quarrying mechanics. Everything targets `Eco.ReferenceAssemblies` (v0.13.0-beta as of Cycle 13) and builds with `dotnet build`; see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the full project layout, code-generation notes, and conventions.

The mods fall into a few clusters. The **BunWulf** family (Agricultural,
Biochemical, Educational, HardwareCo) adds extended farming and crop variety,
a plant-based Biochemist profession as an alternative to petrochemical oil, a
Librarian profession that can craft skill books across every discipline, and a
handful of specialty hardware items. Standalone mods include
**DirectCarbonCapture** (late-game atmospheric CO2 mitigation), **EcoNil**
(weather and moisture mechanics), **MinesQuarries** (infinite but expensive
mining and quarrying operations, designed around vertical integration),
**ShopBoat** (a mobile shop world object), and **WorldCounter** (world
statistics tracking). CI publishes each mod as an independent, install-ready
Forgejo generic package. [The package guide](../docs/mod-packages.md) documents
the Git LFS boundary and archive layout.

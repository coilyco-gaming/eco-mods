# eco-mods-public

A collection of public C# gameplay mods for [Eco](https://play.eco/), Strange Loop Games' multiplayer survival and simulation game. The mods add new professions, recipes, crafting stations, farming extensions, environmental systems, and mining and quarrying mechanics. Everything targets `Eco.ReferenceAssemblies` (v0.13.0-beta as of Cycle 13) and builds with `dotnet build`; see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the full project layout, code-generation notes, and conventions.

The mods fall into a few clusters. The **BunWulf** family (Agricultural, Biochemical, Educational, HardwareCo) adds extended farming and crop variety, a plant-based Biochemist profession as an alternative to petrochemical oil, a Librarian profession that can craft skill books across every discipline, and a handful of specialty hardware items. Standalone mods include **DirectCarbonCapture** (late-game atmospheric CO2 mitigation), **EcoNil** (weather and moisture mechanics), **MinesQuarries** (infinite but expensive mining and quarrying operations, designed around vertical integration), **ShopBoat** (a mobile shop world object), and **WorldCounter** (world statistics tracking). Released builds are distributed as `.zip` files at the repo root; AGENTS.md documents the asset packaging and deploy workflow.
